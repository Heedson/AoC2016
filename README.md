# Advent of Code 2016
This repo will contain my solutions to the Advent of Code 2016 challenges.

The project operates from running `main.go` in the base of the repo and passing a value with the flag `-day`.

The input file will be read from within the individual day folders.

All source will be up-to-date with the completed parts of each day (If the day has been completed, only part 2 will be usable).

## Example usage
`go run main.go -day 1`

This will run the 1st day's challenge.

## Days completed
- Day 1
- Day 2
